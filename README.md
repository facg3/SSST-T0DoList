## Project #2: TODO-LIST Application.

## WHY:
Web is now the most accessible Life feature in the whole world, it's growing even bigger than it is, and it will continue shaping our lives. So, we thought.. Why not bring up a ToDo List application on a web page! We know lots will like it.

## WHAT:
TODO-LIST Application is a public opened webpage that allown any user to have his own daily ToDo list, it's simple, pretty, and awesome!

## HOW:
We in SSST Band decided to work as pairs, which make it easier for us to build a completely multi-vision web-page, this means, we are putting 4 minds into one web-page, and that what made it: Simple, Pretty, and Awesome!

### Then: 
- We devided our project into peaces, five main files that containes almost everything we are doing:
  1. logic.js : it's the hidden functional file!
  2. dom.js : it's the one which draws everything from/into the index.html.
  3. index.html : it's the one that the user will be interacting with.
  4. style.css : it's the one that contains all the styling into >3.
  5. test.js : it's the one that we developed to make sure everything on our Logic file.

- From here, we divided each file into two halves, and each pair accomplished his own part.

# and that's it ;)
